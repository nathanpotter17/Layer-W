# LAYER-W - Near Native Web Execution Layer for Games & Applications

### Layer Stack

- rust, wasm_bindgen, cargo, web_sys, js_sys, wasm32-unknown-unknown, wasm32-wasip1/p2, bash

### Layer Goals

- Robust and Tuneable memory
- Mesh LOD / streaming system = A/AA Shading Quality @ ~60FPS

### Layer Limits

- Memory

  - Total Memory Limit is advertised as 4GB, however, available memory is only 2GB in Chrome, workers can sometimes get the full 4GB. There is a caveat here though, a single JS Worker can request all 4GB, so isolated engine systems can run in workers if shared memory or coalescence isn't as important. Theoretical limit for memory in workers case would be some large amount of memory. [WASM Memory Alloc Issue](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/chrome-wasm32-4gb-2gb-limits-workarounds/78161/5)

- Devices
- `wgpu Device`
  - pub fn features(&self) -> Features The features which can be used on this device. No additional features can be used, even if the underlying adapter can support them.
  - pub fn limits(&self) -> Limits The limits which can be used on this device. No better limits can be used, even if the underlying adapter can support them.
  - Drawing system supports many platforms through winit (rwh) + wgpu pipeline. Fixed resolution TBD, but likely 1080 x 720.

### WASM as a Flexible Tool

Containers too heavy for IOT, need linux, then runtime, then container image. WASM is perfect for server usecases in this sense because far less platform specific code ends up on server devices, preventing the need for costly redeploy. API Gateway is most popular usecase for this server usecase, sitting as a middle layer between client and host. wasm-micro-runtime and wasm3 runtimes are meant for IOT.

### Host Runtimes Browser, Wasmtime, WAMR https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/tree/main

- LayerW: Open World, Distribution and Networking first engine

  - Asset Pipeline / Content System
    - asset loading system is LOD / streaming based - apart from small static definitions
      - Memory and Game Data should be represented as Float32Array or similar typed array whenever possible. js_sys objects are
  - Architecture
    - Architecture is Component based, Streaming oriented, distribution first.
  - Build System
    - Build uses Cargo, Bash, wasm-bindgen, wasm-pack, wasmtime, some native toolchains may be supported pending WASI GFX (TBD). Use wasm-opt or Binaryen for optimization
  - Memory: Wasm shared memory, memory views, constraints, and rust data management + types

    - Pre-optimized memory pools established AOT. (Re-cycled continuously, Achieved 4GB max limit through gradual growth)

      - Optimized for WASM's 32-bit address space, and page style memory allocation.
        - Circumvent memory contraints by utilizing `webworker, js_sys::ArrayBuffer, or js_sys::SharedArrayBuffer`.

        - [Chromium Single Tab Memory Limits](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-dev/c/IKZvzuBP9QE/m/caF-Yge4AwAJ)
        - Consider using a "Ventilated" Allocator (Heap is overwritten continously)

    - Instancing, SIMD, and other memory improvements are _highly preferred_ in WASM.
      - Allocate dedicated memory regions for different Layer systems, Organize memory by object lifetime expectations and based on usage size - Small objects (â‰¤64 bytes), medium objects (65-1024 bytes), large objects (>1KB)
        - De-fragmentation routines may be necessary for large games, especially for large single levels.
    - Memory chunks are 64KiB, the max size of a WASM Page.
    - For extra optimizations, BVH or similar algo can be used to render maximum LOD in a smaller area.
    - 2^16 pages is 2^16 \* 64KiB = ~ 4GiB (4194304 bytes), which is the maximum range that a Wasm module can address, as Wasm currently only allows 32-bit addressing (address space is 2^32).

      - Games with large levels stream in content from within its current memory region - think Minecraft, or tile-based games.

  - Rendering

    - WebGPU or wgpu, canvas is rendering surface. OR, Ideally [WASI GFX](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-gfx) or [Wander GPU Framework](https://github.com/renderlet/wander) which are highly experimental (April 2025) and use the WASI ABI convention, allowing LayerW to use SDL2 exclusively.

      - Games will rival visual quality comparable to mid-tier AA games from a few years ago, or stylized games with more modern rendering approaches.
      - Windowing, input & sound: SDL2 on native, Gamepad Web API
      - Rendering approach could boil down to this CPP alternative, used in a previous project. Web Sys or similar may have [GPU functions available](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/gpu_buffer_usage/index.html);

        - Reasoning (found this out organically from Emscripten usage) [Source](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/maximal-webgl2-ram-a-rust-wasm32-program-can-use-on-latest-chrome/72457/4)

          ```
            You can load an ArrayBuffer, and pass that to buffer_data_with_array_buffer_view, all without allocating any memory in wasm itself. The limits here are going to be identical to whatever plain JS and WebGL can do.

            Similarly, you can create texture objects from HtmlImageElements, within wasm code, without actually loading those images as bitmap data into wasm memory.

            Otoh if you want to load a huge Vec<u8> on the Rust side, you are limited by wasm memory constraints, whether you intend to upload that as a WebGL buffer or not.
          ```

        - ```c++
            // See https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/module.html#creating-the-module-object for interacting with the Module object, however exporting
            // this function adds overhead instead of just calling the function directly here using the EM_ASM macro. Also could lead to race conditions.
            EM_ASM({
                const canvas = Module.canvas;
                const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true });

                // Directly access the memory buffer from JavaScript
                // https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html#access-memory-from-javascript

                const imgData = new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(HEAPU8.subarray($0, $0 + $1)), $2, $3);
                ctx.putImageData(imgData, 0, 0);
                console.log("Frame rendered");
            }, rgbaFrame.data, FRAME_SIZE, FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT);
          ```

Next Steps:

- Write an allocator for WASM memory in Rust &check;
- Make it a tiered allocator, for each of the memory regions needed for level functioning. Level logic, meshes, textures, etc.
  - While the rest of the core engine functions live in stack memory, our allocator always measures itself first, and offsets from there as the start so that memory regions can stay protected.
    - Later: Make the tiered allocator tied to the distance function on the player controller's camera during rendering to cull assets...
