# Layer-W - Near Native Web Execution Layer for Games

### How would a Near Native Web Execution Layer work for Apps & Games using WASM + WebGPU + Rust?

1. **Clients Layer**

   - Browser: Loads and manages the WASM modules
   - Canvas Element: Provides the rendering surface for game frames
   - Native Binary Option: For desktop platforms, can use the same codebase to write games / apps.

2. **Hybrid Core Layer**

   - **Native Performance Engine**: Keeps performance-critical systems in native code
     - Rendering Pipeline: Direct hardware access for graphics operations
     - Memory Management: Custom allocators optimized for game workloads
     - Core Physics: Time-critical simulation components
   - **WASM Modules**: For portable, secure execution of:
     - Game Logic: Gameplay mechanics, AI, scripting
     - Event and Input Management
     - Non-Critical Systems: UI, audio processing, network protocols
     - Modding Support: User-generated content and extensions
   - **WebGPU Direct Integration**: Direct WebGPU API access
     - Shared GPU buffer objects across execution domains
     - WebGPU compute shaders for parallelizable workloads

3. **Progressive Enhancement Architecture**

   - Baseline Web Experience: Core functionality via WebGPU and basic WASM
   - Enhanced Native Experience: Full optimizations when running in native WASM runtime with WASI
   - Full Performance Mode: Complete native execution when available

4. **Storage & Distribution Layer**
   - Efficient Asset Management: On-demand loading with regional caching
   - Pre-optimized Memory Pools: Established before execution begins
   - Component Model Packages: Clean interfaces between subsystems

## Data Flow

### The execution process works in three main cycles:

1. **Frame Rendering Cycle**

   - Game Data → Appropriate Execution Context (Native/WASM) → WebGPU → Canvas Element
   - Performance-critical rendering occurs in native context when possible
   - WebGPU provides consistent API surface across platforms

2. **Input Processing Cycle**

   - Browser/Platform → Input Handler → Appropriate System (Native/WASM)
   - Input processing prioritizes low latency paths

3. **Asset Loading Cycle**
   - Storage → WebAssembly Component Model → Runtime
   - Strategic caching and preloading based on usage patterns

## Strategic Memory Management

- **Pre-allocated Memory Pools**: Establish optimized memory layouts before execution begins
- **Custom Allocators**: Implement domain-specific allocators optimized for WebAssembly's constraints
- **Explicit Memory Transfer Protocols**: Define clear data ownership and transfer patterns between native and WASM components

## Component Model Integration

The WebAssembly Component Model provides:

- Clean interfaces between engine subsystems
- Interface types for seamless data exchange
- Plugin architecture based on imports/exports
- Strong typing and versioning for stable interfaces

## How is it better than having a normal distributed server architecture?

### The hybrid architecture using WASI, the WASM Component Model, and WebGPU provides several key advantages:

1. **True Platform Independence with Performance Optimization**

   - WASM + Component Model: Enables components from any language to run safely in any compliant runtime
   - WASI: Abstracts OS-level dependencies while allowing performance-critical paths to remain native
   - Performance-first approach: Native code where needed, WASM where beneficial

2. **Ultra-Light Client Experience**

   - Progressive asset loading: Clients stream assets and logic on demand
   - Fast Boot: The app loads core functionality first, then enhances progressively
   - Lower barriers for users while maintaining high-quality experience

3. **Direct GPU Access via WebGPU**

   - WebGPU: Direct access to modern graphics APIs without translation layers
   - Consistent API across platforms: Develop once for all platforms
   - Hardware-accelerated rendering with minimal overhead

4. **Simplified Infrastructure & Maintenance**

   - Unified codebase with clear boundaries between native and WASM components
   - Consistent execution across platforms with native performance where needed
   - Clear separation of concerns through Component Model interfaces

5. **Security & Isolation by Design**

   - WASM Sandbox: Memory-safe execution for non-critical systems
   - WASI Capability-based security: System-level access is opt-in and well-defined
   - Fine-grained control over which components get which permissions

6. **Better Scalability for Live Streaming & Real-time Games**

   - Modular architecture: Components can be loaded/unloaded dynamically
   - Stateless design where appropriate: Facilitates scaling and recovery
   - Efficient state synchronization through well-defined interfaces

7. **Future-Ready and Modular**
   - Component Model enables runtime composition of system elements
   - Well-defined interfaces ensure compatibility across versions
   - Pluggable architecture for AI, physics, analytics without changing core systems

## Summary:

### This hybrid approach preserves the vision of Layer-W while addressing technical limitations:

- Preserves native performance for critical paths while gaining WASM benefits
- Reduces complexity through clear component boundaries
- Maintains security & memory access control
- Improves performance by eliminating unnecessary translation layers
- Lowers infrastructure costs through efficient resource utilization
- Future-proofs projects through modularity and standard interfaces
- Achieves closer to native execution speed by focusing WASM use appropriately
- Can be implemented incrementally, starting with specific subsystems

## Challenges & Solutions
